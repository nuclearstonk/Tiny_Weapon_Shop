credits:
Why485 for Tiny Combat Arena and its wonderful moddability and assets as reference
@Ghaaaaa for most of the US air to ground weapon models
@nuclearstonk for all of the AAMs and all of the .json work
ravenclaw_007 for beautiful, highly detailed and accurate visual models, that we have used as references to build our own models off of

sources:
for sources of data for jsons, i primarily try to find research papers for the most accurate data, then go to DCS/BMS forums if there's data possible, then secretprojects forum, then WT forums, then sites like globalsecurity.com/missilery.info, corroborated with DCS data values, and if possible i scour RU forums for data mentions of these systems given their fearlessness of persecution and willingness to argue until one side shows data from physical books in a neatly organized digital medium.
