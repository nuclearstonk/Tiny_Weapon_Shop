place \V0.64 TWS\ within \Steam\steamapps\common\TinyCombatArena\Mods\ in your TCA directory
set up loadouts yourself or wait until Why485 adds customizable loadouts ingame, there are tutorials in the modding discord
to ensure the mod loaded properly, check the ingame database to see if you have over 10 pages of weapons
if not, try re-installing the mod

this mod has no dependencies, but several other mods rely on this mod being properly installed to function as intended
