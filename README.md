Tiny Weapon Shop V0.5 Beta


large weapon pack with weapons from a variety of nations from a variety of eras
includes 300+ weapons,from bombs to air-to-air missiles, all with the most accurate specifications that i can find
will include more weapons in the future with more functionality and documentation


new in 0.5:
  Kh-25L/ML/MT/MP
  KAB-500L/Kr
  Red Top
  Database entries for everything
  an lingering thought that i should probably be paid for the work i do

changed/fixed in 0.5:
  added first test batch of missile proportionality (some missiles try to choose zero-effort terminal intercepts on maneuvering targets to take advantage of high G limits)
  above change significantly helps certain more struggly limited/early all-aspect IR AAMs
  renamed AIM-260B to a more correct AIM-160
  significant seeker range and countermeasure resistance buff to R-60 series (they were massively underperforming sorry)
  increases to soviet IR missile countermeasure resistance (soviet air forces made use of increased performance high intensity flares during testing, much more effective than NATO flares.)
  rebalanced all A/G weapons to use TSC's standard (will remain relatively balanced against mods using a more vanilla approach)
  huge rebalance to basically every IR weapon, tell me if things work better

upcoming (in no particular order and not necessarily next update):
  more weapons of all types
  
  

place \V0.5 TWS\ within \Steam\steamapps\common\TinyCombatArena\Mods\ in your TCA directory
set up loadouts yourself or wait until Why485 adds customizable loadouts ingame, there are tutorials in the modding discord
to ensure the mod loaded properly, check the ingame database to see if you have over 10 pages of weapons
if not, try re-installing the mod

this mod has no dependencies, but several other mods rely on this mod being properly installed to function as intended

sources:
for sources of data for jsons, i primarily try to find research papers for the most accurate data,
then go to DCS/BMS forums if there's data possible, then secretprojects forum, then WT forums,
then sites like globalsecurity.com/missilery.info, corroborated with DCS data values,
and if possible i scour RU forums for data mentions of these systemsgiven their fearlessness of persecution
and willingness to argue until one side shows data from physical books in a neatly organized digital medium.
