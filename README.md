Tiny Weapon Shop V0.8 Beta


large weapon pack with weapons from a variety of nations from a variety of eras
includes 340+ weapons, from bombs to air-to-air missiles, all with the most accurate specifications that i can find
will include more weapons in the future with more functionality and documentation


new in 0.8:
  Kh-28
  Kh-58/U
  Kh-59 + APK-9 datalink pod
  CBU-24
  MAA-1 piranha AAM
  nuclear R-33
  nuclear AGM-12D
  Aspide 2000
  remodeled JASDF AAMs
  remodeled AMRAAMs
  remodeled R-27s
  added alt sparrow variants for aspide and skyflash
  

changed/fixed in 0.8:
  redone all of the IR missiles. all of them. they all have different countermeasure stats now and the russian ones are no longer broken. every single one has been changed with zero exceptions
  tweaked Kh-29 fins
  tweaked min/optimal speeds for missiles (still wip)
  all bombs have increased impact damage and are balanced for future naval assets
  all laser guided weapons are now laser guided
  fixed all the alignments of all of the sparrow missiles. incredibly annoying but necessary
  bullpups are scaled properly
  walleyes have proper fins and are scaled properly
  M117s are scaled properly
  cluster bombs are scaled properly
  removed MIM-72 as it belongs with TSC
  AGM-65 now with proper drag characteristics (doubled speed and effective kinematic range)
  PL-15E has a unique model (i accidentally gave it the PL-15A's model all this time)
  

upcoming (in no particular order and not necessarily next update):
  more weapons of all types
  
  

place \V0.8 TWS\ within \Steam\steamapps\common\TinyCombatArena\Mods\ in your TCA directory
set up loadouts yourself or wait until Why485 adds customizable loadouts ingame, there are tutorials in the modding discord
to ensure the mod loaded properly, check the ingame database to see if you have over 10 pages of weapons
if not, try re-installing the mod

this mod has no dependencies, but several other mods rely on this mod being properly installed to function as intended
