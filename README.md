place \V.01 TWS\ within \Steam\steamapps\common\TinyCombatArena\Mods\ in your TCA directory
set up loadouts yourself or wait until Why485 adds customizable loadouts ingame, there are tutorials in the modding discord
to ensure the mod loaded properly, check the ingame database to see if the AGM-65D has a transparent seeker dome
if not, try re-installing the mod

this mod has no dependencies, but several other mods rely on this mod being properly installed to function as intended

@Ghaaaaa for most of the US air to ground weapon models
@nuclearstonk for all of the AAMs and all of the .json work

that we have used as references to build our own models off of

 

sources:
for sources of data for jsons, i primarily try to find research papers for the most accurate data,
then go to DCS/BMS forums if there's data possible, then secretprojects forum, then WT forums,
then sites like globalsecurity.com/missilery.info, corroborated with DCS data values,
and if possible i scour RU forums for data mentions of these systemsgiven their fearlessness of persecution
and willingness to argue until one side shows data from physical books in a neatly organized digital medium.
