Tiny Weapon Shop V0.7 Beta


large weapon pack with weapons from a variety of nations from a variety of eras
includes 320+ weapons,from bombs to air-to-air missiles, all with the most accurate specifications that i can find
will include more weapons in the future with more functionality and documentation


new in 0.7:
  new model for AIM-9R

changed/fixed in 0.7:
  weapon rework for 0.15
  a/g weapons have new damage and pen values
  

upcoming (in no particular order and not necessarily next update):
  more weapons of all types
  
  

place \V0.7 TWS\ within \Steam\steamapps\common\TinyCombatArena\Mods\ in your TCA directory
set up loadouts yourself or wait until Why485 adds customizable loadouts ingame, there are tutorials in the modding discord
to ensure the mod loaded properly, check the ingame database to see if you have over 10 pages of weapons
if not, try re-installing the mod

this mod has no dependencies, but several other mods rely on this mod being properly installed to function as intended
